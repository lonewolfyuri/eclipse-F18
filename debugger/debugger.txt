Programming Assignment #0, Part C

Run the craps program controlled by the Debugger Perspective as specified in the
programming assignment, to answer each the following questions. When asked to
show dice "throws" each throw is the sum of the two dice values, not the values
of the individual dice. So in 2 and and 6, if the thows were 8 (4+4), 6(2+4),
and 7(3+4), losing by not making the points 8, you would write just 8, 6, 7
(the sums).
